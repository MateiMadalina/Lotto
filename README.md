# Lotto 

## About Project
This project represents my first step in Java and aimed to familiarize myself with the syntax of this language after transitioning from JavaScript to Java. It is a simple implementation of a lottery, where the user inputs 6 numbers from the console. Subsequently, 6 random numbers are generated, and then the numbers entered by the user are compared with the randomly generated ones to determine if there is a match and, implicitly, if the user has won.
